# Catodoro
A web-based productivity timer.
The timer counts down a focus session.
The default duration of a focus session is 25 minutes.
The user can set a custom duration.
When the timer expires, the application plays one random cat “meow” sound chosen from a set of 25 different sounds.
The application has a humorous cat-themed user interface.
